        <p>Want a great job in tech? Want a six-figure salary? Then you have come to the right place. I am going to tell
            you all you need to know to get all of that and much more, without you lifting a finger. You can learn
            passively. Just sit back, close your eyes, and let the sound of my voice make the code sink deep into your
            brain.</p>
